Hello, my name is Kyle Yang and I am currently studying web development and mobile applications development at Moraine Park based in Wisconsin. I'm currently learning about Javascript, HTML5, CSS, UI/UX design/development, and more. 

Im interested in making new connections and looking to collaborate on anything that will give me experience about web developing or mobile applications development.
